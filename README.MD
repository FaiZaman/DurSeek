# DurSeek

# Setup

Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory (DurSeek) in a terminal window. Type `python Game.py` to run the game.

# Game

At the start screen, press `E` for easy mode, `M` for medium mode, or `H` for hard mode.
Move and jump using the arrow keys or `WASD`, and press the spacebar to shoot a fireball.

After the game is over (whether you win or lose), use the same options as at the start screen (`E, M, H`) to replay.

Turn up the volume on your system to hear the music, and collect all 10 treasures to win! Avoid falling off the screen and keep ahead of the red bar behind you - if it catches up to you, you lose. Also avoid the red and black enemies.
